Then, answer the question that follows.\n\nEddie, a tech enthusiast with a deep love for keyboards, entered the hall with an eager stride. His eyes lit up at the sight of the familiar keys and buttons neatly arranged on the table. The keyboard, his trusted companion for countless coding sessions and late-night gaming, had found its place in the hallâ€”an essential part of Eddie's workspace.\n\nOn the other hand, Nicole, known for her inconsiderate nature, entered the hall with a scowl on her face.
